# Coursera - Developing Data Products Project 2

In this project, a Shiny application is created and will be deployed on RStudio's servers. Here, a simple tool would be made to visualize COVID-19 data. For this application, the data would be obtained in real time from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data) which is constantly updated by [Johns Hopkins University](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html).

The link for the completed Shiny app can be found [here](https://dillonchewwx.shinyapps.io/coursera-ddp-project2/).
